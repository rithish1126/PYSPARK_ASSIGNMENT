Praneeth's code review 

1)Code retrieves COVID-19 data from an API, cleans it, analyzes it using PySpark, and creates a RESTful API to display the analyzed results.
2)The data is retrieved from the API, cleaned, and stored in a cleaned format. 
3)The api_flask.py file displays the desired output data by specifing the different parameters using different methods.

5)The analyzed data is displayed in a JSON format when the API is accessed.
